    <h3>What are cookies on websites?</h3>
    <p>
      Cookies are small files of information that a web server generates and
      sends to a web browser. Web browsers store the cookies they receive for a
      predetermined period of time, or for the length of a user's session on a
      website. They attach the relevant cookies to any future requests the user
      makes of the web server.
    </p>
    <h3>Where are cookies stored?</h3>
    <p>
      Web browsers store cookies in a designated file on users' devices. The
      Google Chrome web browser, for instance, stores all cookies in a file
      labeled "Cookies." Chrome users can view the cookies stored by the browser
      by opening developer tools, clicking the "Application" tab, and clicking
      on "Cookies" in the left side menu.
    </p>
    <h2>What are the different types of cookies?</h2>
    <p>Some of the most important types of cookies to know include:</p>
    <h3>Session cookies</h3>
    <p>
      A session cookie helps a website track a user's session. Session cookies
      are deleted after a user's session ends â€” once they log out of their
      account on a website or exit the website. Session cookies have no
      expiration date, which signifies to the browser that they should be
      deleted once the session is over.
    </p>
    <h3>Persistent cookies</h3>
    <p>
      Unlike session cookies, persistent cookies remain in a user's browser for
      a predetermined length of time, which could be a day, a week, several
      months, or even years. Persistent cookies always contain an expiration
      date.
    </p>
    <h3>Authentication cookies</h3>
    <p>
      Authentication cookies help manage user sessions; they are generated when
      a user logs into an account via their browser. They ensure that sensitive
      information is delivered to the correct user sessions by associating user
      account information with a cookie identifier string. Tracking
    </p>
    <h3>Tracking cookies</h3>
    <p>
      Tracking cookies are generated by tracking services. They record user
      activity, and browsers send this record to the associated tracking service
      the next time they load a website that uses that tracking service.
